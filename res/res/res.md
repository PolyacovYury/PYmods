Alongside this file there has to be a folder named "vehicles/" which stores all the remods' data and the "audioww/" folder with all the sound banks for the build scripts to work properly.

I don't include them into this repository, otherwise git chokes up trying to process almost 2 GB of files.

All files can be downloaded here:
